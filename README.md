# Perun mobile bindings
This project provides Android bindings for [go-perun](https://github.com/perun-network/go-perun) called *prnm*.  
Right now, it supports two-party single-asset ledger payment channels.

## Structure

The `android/` folder is an Android Studio Project, the only two important files are:  
- `android/app/src/main/java/network/perun/app/MainActivity.java` contains the Apps logic, exemplifying the use of `go-perun`.  
The `MainActivity` uses a `Node` to propose and accept payment channels.
The `Node` is started with a `prnm.Config` which contains all needed configuration for the underlying `prnm.Client`. Its contructor creates a `ProposalHandler` that accepts all incomming channel proposals and forwards the new channels to `Node.accept`. `Node.accept` then starts two threads; one with an `UpdateHandler` that accepts all updates and one as on-chain watcher that reacts to disputes and settling. To propose a channel, `Node.propose` can be used.  
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` lists the needed App permissions; `INTERNET`,`ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`,`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`,`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`

After importing the `android/` folder in Android Studio, run it in the Emulator or on a real phone.  
The opposite party can be either also an App, or a [perun-eth-demo](https://github.com/perun-network/perun-eth-demo)-node.
